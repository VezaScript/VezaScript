### Heyo! I'm Veza!

Coding is like a box of chocolates, you never know where the semicolon is.
I do like coding (I'm on GitHub, of course I like coding)
Contact me on discord at Veza#3098 if you need anything
My pronouns are He/Him (I don't care about pronouns)
Fun fact, Veza means Connection in spanish.

Have a good day.
